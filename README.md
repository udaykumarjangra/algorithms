## READY FOR THE HACKTOBER FEST 😈😈

## ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

The aim of this program is to help the participants explore the Open Source world and take their first step towards programming and contributing.

This is a great repository for the Beginers in the Open Source and the beginers in the virtual world of computer science 🤩🤩

[REGISTER HERE](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) to win a limited edition Hacktoberfest 👕Tee-shirt or a 🎍plant. But you need to hurry!🥶

So, Start contributing!😁😁😁

## WHAT ARE ALGORITHMS 🤓🤓

<p>

An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem. 😮😮

Algorithms are widely used throughout all areas of IT (information technology). A search engine algorithm, for example, takes search strings of keywords and operators as input, searches its associated database for relevant web pages, and returns results. 🤩🤩

An encryption algorithm transforms data according to specified actions to protect it. A secret key algorithm such as the U.S. Department of Defense's Data Encryption Standard (DES), for example, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. As long as the algorithm is sufficiently sophisticated, no one lacking the key can decrypt the data. 😎😎
