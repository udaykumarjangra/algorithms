DFS Algorithm that is known as (Depth-First Search) for traversing of a graph. Traversal of the
Graph is visiting exactly once each vertex or node and edge, in a well-defined order. Also, it
is very important to keep track of the vertices those have been visited so that the same vertex is
not traversed twice.<br>
Depth first traversal or Depth first Search is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices
of a graph or tree data structure. It explores all the nodes by going forward if possible or uses
backtracking. Depth-first search is used in topological sorting, scheduling problems, cycle
detection in graphs, and solving puzzles with only one solution, such as a maze or a sudoku
puzzle. Other applications involve analyzing networks, for example, testing if a graph is
bipartite. Depth-first searches are used in mapping routes, scheduling, and finding spanning
trees.
